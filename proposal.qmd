import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

## Goal

My goal is to develop a transparent and accurate machine learning model that can classify news articles as fake or real based on their textual content and identify the words or phrases most predictive of fake news.

## Dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false
fake_real_news = pd.read_csv("data/fake_or_real_news_data.csv")

# Rename unnamed column
fake_real_news.rename(columns={"Unnamed: 0": "article #"}, inplace=True)

# Print column names
display(fake_real_news.columns)

# Print data types & shape of data
display(fake_real_news.info())
```

The dataset I am using for the project is the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle. It consists of roughly 6,300 rows with four columns representing article title, text content, and label (fake or real). I will combine the title and text for a comprehensive representation; this dataset is appropriate for the project because it provides balanced and diverse examples of fake and real news. I chose this dataset because it includes the full details of articles and it's also large enough to train the model and make predictions.

## Questions

Can we build an effective and interpretable fake news classifier using TF-IDF and machine learning?

Can we identify which words or phrases are most predictive of fake news content using categorical features?

```{python}
#| label: sentiment-features
#| message: false
from textblob import TextBlob

# Function to get sentiment scores
def get_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(str(text))  # Ensure it's a string
    return pd.Series([blob.sentiment.polarity, 
                      blob.sentiment.subjectivity])

# Title sentiment features
fake_real_news[['title_polarity', 
                'title_subjectivity']] = fake_real_news['title'].apply(get_sentiment)

# Text sentiment features
fake_real_news[['text_polarity', 
                'text_subjectivity']] = fake_real_news['text'].apply(get_sentiment)

# Preview the new dataset with sentiment features
fake_real_news.head()
```

## Feature Engineering

| Feature | Description |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| title_polarity | Sentiment score of the title from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive) |
| title_subjectivity | Subjectivity score of the title from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective) |
| text_polarity | Sentiment score of the full text from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive) |
| text_subjectivity | Subjectivity score of the full text from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective) |

## Analysis plan

-   First, I will preprocess the data and apply TF-IDF to extract relevant textual features.
-   Next, I will train machine learning classifiers and evaluate their performance to assess effectiveness.
-   Finally, I will interpret the model to identify which words or patterns most strongly predict fake news.

## Weekly Plan

| Week | Task |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1 | Data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis. Implement TF-IDF vectorization and basic logistic regression model. |
| 2 | Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. Extract top predictive words/phrases using model coefficients. Begin documentation of results. |
| 3 | Prepare final analysis and visualizations of predictive words. Write up project report, finalize README files, and organize code repository structure. |
