It consists of roughly 6,300 rows with four columns representing article title, text content, and label (fake or real). I will combine the title and text for a comprehensive representation; this dataset is appropriate for the project because it provides balanced and diverse examples of fake and real news. I chose this dataset because it includes the full details of articles and it’s also large enough to train the model and make predictions."
